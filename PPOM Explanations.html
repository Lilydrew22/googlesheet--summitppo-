If you are participating with Cigna on their Advantage plan, you are in-network for all patients and are reimbursed the same fees for all patients.  While participation in the DPPO network allows an office/provider to see all Cigna patients, Cigna limits the fee (amount Cigna will pay) for a DPPO Advantage member. You may see differences in reimbursements based on the actual plan limits for the Advantage member.  <br><br>The Cigna DPPO network does fall under the leasing relationships.  However, optimization with Cigna can take a very long time, especially after a direct contract termination and they will send letters to their patients advising them of your termination.  Additionally, Cigna reviews the leasing network reimbursements and compares it to the office direct contract fees.  If the intended network fee schedule is too high, such as a large gap from the original direct fees, or the leasing network fee schedule is unreasonably high, Cigna will block adding the provider under the leasing network. This means that you will remain completely out of network.  <br><br>If you are looking to move this participation, you will need to call Cigna (Provider Relations: 800-244-6224 (provider, TIN, contracting, dental)) to ask about your participation or send us a redacted EOB so we can review your participation.</td><td class="s4"></td><td class="s5"></td></tr><tr style="height: 19px"><th id="1004599919R10" style="height: 19px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 19px">11</div></th><td class="s6" dir="ltr">Connection (Alternative Fee Schedule)</td><td class="s7" dir="ltr"></td><td class="s7" dir="ltr"></td><td class="s9" dir="ltr">Connection does not always negotiate in a typical fashion.
